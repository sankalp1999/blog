College is a time when we cross each other's paths in space and time. wildly different paths.

![crossing of paths in space-time](/images/college_friends.png)

Very close friends going for masters, friends going to different cities, batchmates whom you didn't know but are now your colleague or they live near you. You may be in the same city or different cities, nevertheless your lives are different with very different paths. Why I emphasize a different path, it’s because we think we are very similar due to the times when our paths cross, but the non-crossing paths, the aspects of other's lives we don't know, their family background, socio-economic condition & other 1000 different things make the difference.

We may have spent a lot of time with them which leads us to think that we are similar in terms of interests, smartness, socioeconomic conditions, and many other factors. Add to that the inherent randomness in life and you get very different outcomes post-college. It’s like a bubble where we forget that all of us are unique individuals.

We may compare and tend to think “How is this friend going abroad”, “how did she get into that company, I don’t think she was that smart”, “why am I so behind”. 

So I believe the idea I presented is yet another reason to avoid doing unfair comparisons: Do not take your friends for granted. This is one more reason to acknowledge your friends as human beings who are also the main characters of their own lives, with different dreams, desires, and ambitions; Just because your paths crossed doesn't mean you can compare and take them for granted or judge them over their decisions. Just because your paths crossed, doesn't mean you can compare yourself with them or them with others and take them for granted. You cannot judge them over their decisions and you certainly don’t have the authority to tell them or think about how they should/want to live their life. 

Feel blessed to have met the super-talented ones who made you feel inferior, and cherish the close ones if they are not near. Spend good time with those who are still near you and [note to self: try to keep in contact at least on social media or phone with some]."

I am into RPG games (and isekai anime like “That Time When I Reincarnated As a Slime) and couldn’t help but present an RPGesque analogy.

Friends with whom you are not in contact with anymore, you were like the NPC in their adventure who helped them clear their quests. It was like a side quest for you haha, hope you crossroads again. Look forward to meeting new folks whom you can help in their quests & they can help in yours.

[I think it would be safe to extrapolate this beyond college too, with people whom you cross paths with.]
