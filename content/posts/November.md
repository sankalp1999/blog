## Good stuff I read this month

[A lesson to be unlearn](http://www.paulgraham.com/lesson.html)  


It talks about how school trains us to not learn for tests but 
prepare by hacking it because most tests are created in such a way that they are hackable.
Why they are hackable? The creator of the test did not put enough effort to make it unhackable.
We carry this with us in real life too. Paul discusses how startup founders try to find hacks to 
raise funding and win at market. However, real world is unhackable.

## Some Recap for me

November was an interesting month. I went for my convocation to Manipal and Mangalore.
My mom hadn't seen my college. Visited a few temples in Mangalore and a beach near it.
Panumbur [beach](https://twitter.com/dejavucoder/status/1593949735374635009?s=20&t=q_akLxQQFrZ8FL0HGLNJpQ) was a wholesome experience beach, with golden sand. It was a nice 4 day trip.
Had lots of good food in hotel lol.

Also completed the main story of Horizon Zero: Dawn. What an amazing game. Nice story, amazing graphics,
loved the open world and wandering in the nature. Just walking in the game made me feel good.
I have started playing Uncharted Series. I skipped Uncharted 2

Last few weeks of November, I worked on possibly the biggest ticket / feature so far, pretty challenging.
Infact, I finished the main work just today and now writing some stuff to unwind. I worked with my 
end sem energy for this towards the end. Let's hope that I do not have to make a lot of changes, depends on the PR review.
Music was a great companion while waiting for the API tests to run. 

Loved [Heat Wave Japanese](https://youtu.be/5jbjN0Ai9X4) and [Teenage Blue](https://youtu.be/JVDmY_riDsc). 
Kiss Me More Japanese version and I Want to Stay at Your House heavy carried me through work.

I am not expecting a lot of people to read this but still I am avoiding spilling out much details both of work 
and personal life. Maybe I will make the journal entries private.

That said, I felt pretty low in energy physically and mentally in the 3rd week of November. I don't know.
Maybe I was just sleeping less, maybe I was just being lazy or it is what it is. Moods and feelings 
are a throw of dice.

On TV Show and Anime side of things, I continued watching Breaking Bad, Hunter x Hunter.
Oh yeah, I watched Spirited Away. Good aesthetic, nice world building but overall okayish. It's great for children,
not targeted for adults. I also started with a show called The Good Place. Liked it, will continue with it later.
