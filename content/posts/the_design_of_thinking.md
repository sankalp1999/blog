### The problem solving grind

I was solving an unseen algorithmic problem on Leetcode recently. I worked out some examples, thought of a brute force solution, and brainstormed on possible methods. Tried to fit in some paradigms. I slowly converged towards an optimal solution.

But this led me to think

> Where are these thoughts coming from?

> Do I even have any control?

I can't just start "thinking". These thoughts pop out of nowhere. It is as if the thoughts arise at random intervals of time. For a second, I felt maybe.. if I could know the source of thought, I could somehow control my thinking process and think through the solution. I didn’t want to rely on “the solution or that particular idea striking my mind”.

I became really curious. I flew off to Reddit to check out how thinking works for other people. Here’s the [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/2w7dw8/can_you_describe_you_how_think/)

> The best analogy I can think of is that my brain is full of a fog, with things fading in and out. Usually things are chained together - one thing fades in, causing something related to fade in, etc. Lack of sleep or the like makes the fog denser, meditation makes it thinner.
I actually remember reading an article years ago about an autistic savant who described his brain as being full of little boxes colorful falling into place as he solved math problems.


> I think that thoughts just emerge in my head, while giving me the impression that I consciously made them. For example, if I'm trying to remember which actor played the Terminator, I'm not consciously going through a long list of all possible actor names that I know. Instead, it appears as though my brain automatically presents me with a preselection of one or more names, which seem to come out of nowhere, at no effort of my direct consciousness.

### The Dilemma
I quickly realised that what I actually wanted to do was to condition myself in such a way that I can get the "right" thoughts. Thoughts that
lead me directly to the answer. Thoughts that are in the right direction.

But then how do I know what is "right"?

I reached a dilemma. If I get control over what I want to think, it might not help. In fact, it might prove to be bad because my choice of controlling my thinking can be wrong. (it's really a movement of thoughts stringed together like a linked list)

I realised that the thinking mechanism is already great as it is designed. Randomness is the cause here. The mind provides random thoughts. Based on your will and feeling, you can cling to a certain thought, ask questions, concentrate and eventually generate a string of thoughts.

This is essentially what thinking is. "Thoughts in motion". This choice of exploration followed by exploitation by choice is what makes it valuable. I can't start thinking directly on a new problem. But I can trigger thinking.

How? Asking questions and concentrating on the problem at hand. Working through the examples. Brainstorming. Letting the mind settle and using diffuse thinking.

The whole purpose of brute force (or brainstorming) is to trigger thinking. Now the big question is “But how do I get the right thoughts”

How to get the “right” thoughts
It’s common sense to some extent. By practising more, exposing yourself more and researching, gaining knowledge. After all, where do these thoughts come from? From experience, memories, knowledge, and sensory inputs (Basic Bhagavad Gita Gyaan/knowledge)

What about "right" thoughts? If u want X, then do more of X. [Check the term deliberate practice, useful in a lot of disciplines]

Consume more about X. The more thoughts in your mind about X, the more you are likely to take some action related to X.

What you pay attention to will determine your thoughts.

This also indicates how important attention and awareness management are. Practicing Mindfulness and Meditation helps a lot in this area.
