This enables you to interact with them more easily. Validation is not always about dopamine hits or inflating your ego.\nThe right amount of validation makes interactions easier. And easier interactions help in finding (forming?) your community - like minded people..\nGenuine feedback = better interactions Genuine feedback can lead to better interactions but this system can be gamified. Sometimes, people will agree with you unwillingly, provide flattery to fit in or to get along with you aka fake validation. Ince you see some 2nd order effects of things, you can not avoid feeling manipulative..\nAll of us have done this probably at some point of time, sometimes out of a motive, other times out a need I am still venturing in basic line of thought so nothing new.\ni think manipulation is useful when you are finding to hard to interact with someone, you can always talk to them about their work or some quality \u0026amp; provide some feedback (the thing that people suggest in cold mails lol). This way they might get more open\u0026hellip; \u0026amp; the loop continues.\nI had once tweeted\nsometimes it\u0026rsquo;s hard to decipher whether you are being complimented or manipulated\n{{tweet user=\u0026ldquo;dejavucoder\u0026rdquo; id=\u0026ldquo;1564102877588496384\u0026rdquo;}}\nto which one of my favourite twitter folks @ghuubear had replied\n{{ tweet user=\u0026ldquo;ghuubear\u0026rdquo; id=\u0026ldquo;1564104722620960768\u0026rdquo;}}\n\u0026ldquo;if you can be meaningfully complimented, you can be manipulated. in fact, you\u0026rsquo;re already manipulated when a compliment makes you feel good. the giver\u0026rsquo;s intent doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. My point is slightly different. i\u0026rsquo;m saying it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if someone\u0026rsquo;s intentionally manipulative or not. it only matters if you\u0026rsquo;re easily manipulated\u0026rdquo;\nExcess validation requirement and loneliness It\u0026rsquo;s cool how validation \u0026amp; interactions might be related. If you are seeking lot of dopamine in life(without which you feel bored/bad/emptiness), then you are seeking interactions. This can mean you feel (or are) lonely. Note that You can feel lonely even if you are not alone.\nWhose validation is most important? Your boss\u0026rsquo;s and your mentor\u0026rsquo;s validation are the most important. If you are in college, your professor\u0026rsquo;s or your HOD\u0026rsquo;s validation is most important. The judges who can signficantly change your reality, their validation should be taken seriously.\n","permalink":"/posts/validation/","summary":"This can be found in forms of thread on Twitter here and here\nThe Case Of Validation Getting validation for your work or your takes\u0026hellip; from someone you admire is high likely to mean that they respect you a little bit more than earlier.

But this led me to think\n\u0026mdash; Sankalp Shubham (@dejavucoder) February 15, 2022 The problem solving grind I was solving an unseen algorithmic problem on Leetcode recently. I worked out some examples, thought of a brute force solution, and brainstormed on possible methods. Tried to fit in some paradigms. I slowly converged towards an optimal solution.\nBut this led me to think\nWhere are these thoughts coming from?\nDo I even have any control?\nI can\u0026rsquo;t just start \u0026ldquo;thinking\u0026rdquo;. These thoughts pop out of nowhere. It is as if the thoughts arise at random intervals of time. For a second, I felt maybe.. if I could know the source of thought, I could somehow control my thinking process and think through the solution. I didn’t want to rely on “the solution or that particular idea striking my mind”.\nI became really curious. I flew off to Reddit to check out how thinking works for other people. Here’s the source\nThe best analogy I can think of is that my brain is full of a fog, with things fading in and out. Usually things are chained together - one thing fades in, causing something related to fade in, etc. Lack of sleep or the like makes the fog denser, meditation makes it thinner. I actually remember reading an article years ago about an autistic savant who described his brain as being full of little boxes colorful falling into place as he solved math problems.\nI think that thoughts just emerge in my head, while giving me the impression that I consciously made them. For example, if I\u0026rsquo;m trying to remember which actor played the Terminator, I\u0026rsquo;m not consciously going through a long list of all possible actor names that I know. Instead, it appears as though my brain automatically presents me with a preselection of one or more names, which seem to come out of nowhere, at no effort of my direct consciousness.\nThe Dilemma I quickly realised that what I actually wanted to do was to condition myself in such a way that I can get the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; thoughts. Thoughts that lead me directly to the answer. Thoughts that are in the right direction.\nBut then how do I know what is \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo;?\nI reached a dilemma. If I get control over what I want to think, it might not help. In fact, it might prove to be bad because my choice of controlling my thinking can be wrong. (it\u0026rsquo;s really a movement of thoughts stringed together like a linked list)\nI realised that the thinking mechanism is already great as it is designed. Randomness is the cause here. The mind provides random thoughts. Based on your will and feeling, you can cling to a certain thought, ask questions, concentrate and eventually generate a string of thoughts.\nThis is essentially what thinking is. \u0026ldquo;Thoughts in motion\u0026rdquo;. This choice of exploration followed by exploitation by choice is what makes it valuable. I can\u0026rsquo;t start thinking directly on a new problem. But I can trigger thinking.\nHow? Asking questions and concentrating on the problem at hand. Working through the examples. Brainstorming. Letting the mind settle and using diffuse thinking.\nThe whole purpose of brute force (or brainstorming) is to trigger thinking. Now the big question is “But how do I get the right thoughts”\nHow to get the “right” thoughts It’s common sense to some extent. By practising more, exposing yourself more and researching, gaining knowledge. After all, where do these thoughts come from? From experience, memories, knowledge, and sensory inputs (Basic Bhagavad Gita Gyaan/knowledge)\nWhat about \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; thoughts? If u want X, then do more of X. [Check the term deliberate practice, useful in a lot of disciplines]\nConsume more about X. The more thoughts in your mind about X, the more you are likely to take some action related to X.\nWhat you pay attention to will determine your thoughts.\nThis also indicates how important attention and awareness management are. Practicing Mindfulness and Meditation helps a lot in this area.\n","permalink":"/posts/the_design_of_thinking/","summary":"You can read this article as a Twitter thread here I was solving an algorithmic problem recently.
